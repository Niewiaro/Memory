Memory is a classic memory game implemented in C#. It was developed as a project for the Motorola Academy. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test and improve your memory skills. With its customizable number of words, the game scales automatically to offer an optimal gaming experience. Featuring a colorful interface and various other nice features, Memory Game guarantees an enjoyable gameplay experience.

I developed this game because programming is my passion. I love the freedom and limitlessness that writing code gives me. The ability to create something from scratch and solve problems in multiple ways is incredibly rewarding. With this project, I aim to showcase my programming skills and contribute to the vibrant community of developers. I aspire to become a professional programmer one day, and this project is a step towards realizing that goal.
